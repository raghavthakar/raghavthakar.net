    <h1>Hi! I'm Raghav Thakar</h1>
    <p>For long, I've tried to label what category the things I do fall in. Now, I've given up trying to find the 
        right label for them. I find many, many thing fascinating. I try a lot of stuff, and for the most part I 
        have realised that being interested in many thing has helped me develop a much better appreciation 
        for the wonderful creations around me (and on the internet). So, this is where I try to 
        document what I've been up to, and what I've found interesting recently. So go ahead, wander around here, and see if
        you find something interesting!
