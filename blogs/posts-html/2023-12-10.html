<p>When making coffee using the Bialetti Moka Express, I have struggled with maintaining the temperature once the extraction begins. You see, the process begins with the pot on a medium hot flame (or an electric coil in my case), and the moment extraction begins and you can see delicious golden-brown liquid appear into the collection chamber, the heat needs to be turned down. This allows for a nice and slow extraction without letting the water turn too hot. This is all well and good when you have flame to control. In my case, my electric coil stovetop simply doesn't cool fast enough when I turn it down to low. The result is always coffee that's been to quickly extracted and doesn't have any of the flavour of the grounds. To mitigate this, I pick up the pot the moment I see the first drops of extraction, and periodically keep and remove the pot from the stove, trying to maintain an even extraction speed. Needless to say, results vary every time.</p>
<p>So, what't the point of my rambling like this? Well, today, out of nowhere (not exactly, I saw a similar comment on YouTube) it struck me a solution so stupidly simple, that I was almost ashamed I didn't think of this before.</p>
<div align="center"><i>Keep another coil turned-on on low heat</i></div>

<p>And simply transfer the pot onto it when extraction begins.</p>
<p>Genius.</p></div>
