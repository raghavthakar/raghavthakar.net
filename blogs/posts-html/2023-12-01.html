    <div id="blog-content"><h1>My Favourite Releases From 2023</h1>
<p>It's Spotify wrapped season again! Aside from admiring how genius the idea is (and why more apps and companies don't have a similar feature), I use this as an opportunity to consciously think about which song releases of the year I actually enjoyed the most. These are probably not my most listened-to songs, but definitely the songs I would enjoy the most (maybe sometimes only in the right context) when played.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<h2>Escapism - RAYE, 070 Shake</h2>
<p>Melodic, evolving, lyrically relevant.</p>
<h2>the BLACK seminole. - Lil Yachty</h2>
<p>Pink-Floy-esque stay and restraint with hip-hop's lyricism</p>
<h2>Gorilla - Little Simz</h2>
<p>Clean, reliable, smooth, and fun delivery on a melodically interesting track </p>
<h2>HEAVEN TO ME - Tyler, the Creator</h2>
<p>Tyler happy</p>
<h2>IN THE EVENT OF CHANGE, MONEY &amp; NOTERIETY - Dhanji, Sammad, MLHVR, ishan</h2>
<p>Takes the crown for me. </p>
<h2>(It Goes Like) Nanana - Edit - Peggy Gou</h2>
<p>Guilty easy listening with high sing-along-ability</p>
<h2>Rush - Troye Sivan</h2>
<p>Accessible yet layered production with a killer music video</p>
<h2>Dil Da Pecha - Semwal, Agaazz</h2>
<p>Funky groovy punjabi</p>
<h2>Easy Go! - Raghd</h2>
<p>Surprisingly sticky melody with delibrately subdued vocals on a DnB (or UK Garage? IDK) beat</p>
<h2>Dance the Night - From Barbie the Album - Dua Lipa</h2>
<p>Pure Pop Perfection</p>
<h2>WuShang Clan - Dank Rishu, Foosie gang, Adil</h2>
<p>Rough 'n' Tough Delhi Rap on some old bollywood-inspired beats</p></div>
