# Who Decides What's Goofy?

Here's a question that I've never been given a straight answer to: What makes something goofy? Generally, it's pretty easy to tell when something is cringey. It's easy to tell when something is outdated, passe, obscene, or offensive, even. What makes something goofy though?

I ask this with a straight face. I am genuinely curious. Is there something inherently wrong with wearing my bicycle helmet indoors? No. But I still make sure to never walk in a store or in an academic block with it on. If I do have it on, it has to be with the buckle undone. There's no other way. 

I wonder what inside me makes me do that.
