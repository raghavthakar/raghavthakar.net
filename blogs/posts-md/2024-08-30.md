# I Like the American Professional

Okay, maybe this is not 'American' at all, but recently I have been noticing a different usage of the word professional.

To me, I used professional to describe, essentially, a pro, with 2 main connotations:
- Someone who literall does an activity to earn a living instead of as a pastime
- (Slang-ish) Someone who is very good at a task

However, recently, I have noticed the use of the word 'professional' as an adjective someone who:
- keeps things strictly about business,
- does not let problems from personal life interfere work, 
- always shows up on time
- communicates exactly, and respectfully,
- commits accurately, and delivers reliably,
- is considerate of the working environment they create for other around them.

Keep in mind, the image I am trying to paint is not of someone who is boring, or is like a wall that is impossible to see on the other side of, but rather the ideal teammate; the ideal employee; the ideal leader.

I'd love to be a professional.
