# So, I Just Finished College

I suppose life updates are hardly a compelling read for most, especially when they come from a nobody on the internet (like I am). However, I am determined to document the events of my life in *some* way, even if it is only me who comes back to these posts way in the future. So, here I am.

As of this moment, there are exactly 35 days before I fly to the US to start my PhD at Oregon State University. It's an exciting time for me. I just bid goodbye to Manipal, met some of my closest friends for the last time for who knows how long. It definitely is bittersweet, but if there is something that moving to different places from time to time, working with new people, and having the privilege to travel has taught me - good people, and good friends never completely go out of the picture. They stick with you in some way or other, and remind you of them, even if it is not *by* them.

Safe to say I am looking forward to looking back (haha) at the wonderful memories and friends I have made!
