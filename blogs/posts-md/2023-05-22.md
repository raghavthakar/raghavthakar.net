# What I Learnt Shopping for a Leather Jacket

While visiting my elder brother with my family, the topic of leather jackets came up. It was decided between my father and I that my brother deserved one for making it through his incredibly challenging PhD. And so began our journey of taking over navigation before dinner and delibrately misguiding my brother so as to not spoil the surprise to finally land up at Schott NYC.

Schott definitely has one of the best collection of jackets I have ever seen, and each piece has a 'Buy It For Life'-type value attached to it.

Our search finally landed us two exquisite jackets. One made of cow leather, and one of horse. Horse leather is rarer, more durable, takes more wears to fit to your body, and is about 60-70% more expensive.

My brother was torn. 

While helping him into the horse leather jacket for probably the 7-8th time, I said something that impressed myself (haha).

"You know, Dada (what I call my brother), if you are likely to wear it twice as much, it's as good as 50% off."

We got the horse leather one in the end.
