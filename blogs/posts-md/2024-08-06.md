# Some First For Me

First time seeing a real-life rap cypher (sipher? sypher?). First time dancing at an *actual* dance club (Goodfoot, Portland -- Disco and Funk Mix by the in-house DJs). First time driving on an interstate (I5 from Corvallis to Portland). First time trying on Selvedge Denim (Self Edge in Downtown Portland). First time listening to an audiobook (Kitchen Confidential narrated by Anthony Bourdain himself). First paper accepted anywhere (multi-objective credit assignment for multiagent systems -- MODEM workshop at ECAI 2024). First summer in Corvallis. First time eating barbecue (Botto's BBQ Portland). First time driving to pick someone up from the airport (Eugene airport).

Yes, I backdated this blog post because it was overdue. What about it?
