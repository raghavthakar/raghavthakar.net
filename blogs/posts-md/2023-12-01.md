# My Favourite Releases From 2023

It's Spotify wrapped season again! Aside from admiring how genius the idea is (and why more apps and companies don't have a similar feature), I use this as an opportunity to consciously think about which song releases of the year I actually enjoyed the most. These are probably not my most listened-to songs, but definitely the songs I would enjoy the most (maybe sometimes only in the right context) when played.

In no particular order:
## Escapism - RAYE, 070 Shake
Melodic, evolving, lyrically relevant.
## the BLACK seminole. - Lil Yachty
Pink-Floy-esque stay and restraint with hip-hop's lyricism
## Gorilla - Little Simz
Clean, reliable, smooth, and fun delivery on a melodically interesting track 
## HEAVEN TO ME - Tyler, the Creator
Tyler happy
## IN THE EVENT OF CHANGE, MONEY & NOTERIETY - Dhanji, Sammad, MLHVR, ishan
Takes the crown for me. 
## (It Goes Like) Nanana - Edit - Peggy Gou
Guilty easy listening with high sing-along-ability
## Rush - Troye Sivan
Accessible yet layered production with a killer music video
## Dil Da Pecha - Semwal, Agaazz
Funky groovy punjabi
## Easy Go! - Raghd
Surprisingly sticky melody with delibrately subdued vocals on a DnB (or UK Garage? IDK) beat
## Dance the Night - From Barbie the Album - Dua Lipa
Pure Pop Perfection
## WuShang Clan - Dank Rishu, Foosie gang, Adil
Rough 'n' Tough Delhi Rap on some old bollywood-inspired beats
