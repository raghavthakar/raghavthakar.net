# How I Wish To Remember Myself At 23

At 23 I rode fixed, wore selvedge, wrote code, drove less, hung out a lot, travelled frequently and often not on my own dime, loved the family+gf, cherished deep friendships, listened to all and sometimes too much musc, worked quickly, stayed happy, lived well.
